## Teaching Approach (Approccio Didattico)

- Leverage Greek-Italian similarities (both have Latin roots, similar grammar concepts)
- Note false friends and key differences between Greek and Italian
- Provide examples in context
- Include pronunciation guidance when helpful
- Organize content systematically for easy reference and review
- **IMPORTANT**: ALL markdown files must have a Table of Contents at the top
- **IMPORTANT**: Always keep the Table of Contents updated when adding or modifying sections
- **IMPORTANT**: All files must have navigation links (Back to Index, Back to Vocabulary, etc.)
- **IMPORTANT**: When creating new files or topics, always update `index.md` and parent navigation files
- **IMPORTANT**: Keep the navigation hierarchy consistent: Index → Category → Specific Topic

### Vocabulary Table Structure Rules

When creating vocabulary tables, follow this structure:

1. **Column Order** (left to right):
   - Masculine (Singular | Plural)
   - Feminine (Singular | Plural)
   - Greek translation (Ελληνικά)
   - Pronunciation Masculine (Singular | Plural)
   - Pronunciation Feminine (Singular | Plural)

2. **Table Header Format**:

   ```markdown
   | Masculine | | Feminine | | Greek (Ελληνικά) | Pronunciation (Masculine) | | Pronunciation (Feminine) | |
   |-----------|----------|----------|----------|------------------|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------|----------|
   | **Singular** | **Plural** | **Singular** | **Plural** | | **Singular** | **Plural** | **Singular** | **Plural** |
   ```

3. **Content Rules**:
   - Always include definite articles with nouns (il/lo/la/l'/i/gli/le)
   - Use stress marks (ˈ) in pronunciation to indicate stressed syllables
   - Use ʎi to represent "gli" sound in pronunciations
   - Order rows alphabetically by Italian masculine singular form

4. **Reference Grammar Rules**:
   - When tables involve articles, add a note referencing `rules.md` for detailed article usage
   - Keep grammar explanations in `rules.md`, not in vocabulary files
